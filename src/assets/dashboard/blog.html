			<h4>BLOG: What is Quiz Bomb and how do I play it?</h4>
			<h5>What is Quiz Bomb?</h5>
			<p>Quiz Bomb is Trivia (Quiz) Game where you can play for winning more Game points or for other goodies like Coupons. </p>
			<p>It is a unique game where many players play with each other simultaneously (in real-time) by answering Trivia questions in turns in a limited amount of time. </p>
			<p>Each player is assigned an Avatar which you can see as you join the game or set in your Profile section in future.  </p>
			<p>The Players now will be served a question when their turn comes in a clockwise fashion (the player who is served the first question is chosen at random by the game engine). The Player who’s turn it is to answer can be determined by the Bomb being on that Player’s avatar.  </p>
			
			<b>Questions served to any player will be visible to all players, BUT the answer options will only be visible to the player who’s turn it is.</b>
			
			<p>When your turn comes the Bomb will be on your Avatar (YOU) and you will be displayed answer options. Only one of the options is the correct answer to the question being asked. </p>
			<p>Your objective is to not let the Bomb Blast when it’s your turn. As each Blast will lead to a loss of a life and loss of 3 total lives will lead to you being ejected from the game.</p>
			
			</div>
			
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>When will the Bomb Blast?</h5>
			
			  <ol class="term_tex">
			   <li>Incorrect answer will lead to a Bomb Blast and losing a life. Answer correctly!</li>
			   <li>Time running out. Answer before the time runs out!</li>
			   <li>You may also be ejected from the game and lose without any prizes if you are:
			  <p>- Disconnected from the game server for any reasons like internet connection issue. Please ensure you are in a good Internet connected environment and you don’t have any incoming calls etc to disturb the game.</p>
 <p>- You minimized or closed the browser or app window that you were playing the game in. This can lead to cheating hence we ensure that minimizing window etc are not permitted. </p>
 <p>- Our server detects some malicious traffic or script led action which could be construed as a hacking attempt or cheating.
 </p>

			<h5>WINNING THE GAME</h5>
			<p>The objective of the game is to be the “last person” standing in the game. </p>
			<p>Typically the League Win amount per table (each game session) is the amount which is displayed in the Pot in the middle of the game screen.</p>
<p>
It’s also possible that the prize is not limited to one person (last person standing) these rules are displayed when you enter the game if there is any change.</p>
<p>
Free games (not played by paying Game Points) may also have goodies like coupons and ecommerce vouchers depending on the offer at that time.
</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN PLAY THE GAME SIMULTANEOUSLY</h5>
			<p>When multiple players are matched they all of them join one ‘table’ the maximum number of people on a table can be 2 to 5.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5> CAN I CHOOSE WHO TO PLAY WITH?</h5>
<p>
Currently we don’t offer the ability for players to choose to play together on one table. Infact we try to randomize this to reduce Collusion.</p>
<p>
TIP: However if you are with some friends choosing to play the game by pressing final play button may increase your chances to be matched up with them but it’s by design not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Coming up: Play with friends - soon we will allow you to set up your own table to compete with your friends only who you can invite to the table to play. However this will be purely limited to only friends choosing to play together and no unknown person will be able to join this table.</p>

			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5> What can I win?</h5>
			
			<ol class="term_tex">
			   <li>Game Points! If you choose to play Game and play it by entering by paying Game Points you can win or multiply  Game points which can be then redeemed on our redemption catalogue for mobiles, data packs, gift vouchers etc.</p>
			  
 
			  
				</ol>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>When do I get the winning Game Points?</h5>
			
			<ol class="term_tex">
			   <li>Almost instantly! Winning Game points will be added to your Game wallet immediately.  While we endeavor to have the winning Game points added to your Game wallet instantly sometimes technical issues may occur and at the maximum your winning Game points should be in your wallet within 24 hours.</p>
			   </li>
				</ol>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>When do I get the Digital Goodies?</h5>
			
			<ol class="term_tex">
			<li>Instantly! Typically we display the unlocked eCommerce voucher / coupon on the game end screen immediately.</li>
			   <li>This can be in the form of either:
			  <p>- A coupon code – please take a screen-shot for records to utilize later</p>
			   <p>- 2.	A clickable link to redeem the offer. Please copy this link and save it in your notes or email it to yourself for later use.</p>
			   </li>
			   
			   <li>Please enjoy the benefits of your digital goods as soon as possible as they are often limited by time for use.</li>

			<h5> What are the charges and winning amount?</h5>
			
			<ol class="term_tex">
			<li>Every entrant for a Game will have to pay to enter the game. There are multiple Tables with different amount of entry fee. Choose basis what you’d like to play for.</li>
			   <li>Winner of the game session will get the sum of the amount all players on the table have paid LESS MHG Technologies Platform and Bandwidth Fee of 20% as the Pool amount (Pool amount is the total amount in the middle of the Game Pot).
			   </li>
			   
			   
			   <li>
			   <h5>For example:</h5>
			   5 Players each pay Rs. 20 to play a game and are matched to one table:
			   <p>- Total amount paid: 5 x 20 Game Points = Rs. 100 Game Points</p>
			   <p>- Less MHG Technologies platform and bandwidth fee 20%</p>
			   <p>- Total winning League Win = 80 Game Points for the Winner!</p>
			   </li>
			   <li>In the above example the Winner (last person standing in the game) takes home 80 Game Points by entering with 20 Game Points.</li>
			   
			   <li>While the above example is with just one winner per Game which is typically how the game is there can be rare versions where the winning Pool amount of 80 Game Points is split amongst other players. These rules are clearly displayed at the beginning of each game.</li>
			   <li>Apart from this other players may also get Digital Goodies if its announced.</li>
				</ol>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>Can there be a draw?</h5>
			
			<ol class="term_tex">
			   <li>YES! We realise some games can get too long if the players are skilled hence we terminate very long games (Typically after 10 questions served per player) and the Pool amount (80 Game Points in above example) will be split equally amongst those who are STILL IN THE GAME. 
			   </li>
			   <li>For example, in a very long game: there were 3 players yet playing and the Game was called a draw as over 10 questions were served to each remaining player. At this moment each of the 3 will get an equal share of the League Win which in this illustrative example is 26.60 Game Points (round-off to lower and in 10s of paise)</li>
				</ol>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>FREE GAMES: Since games are free to play and one or all participants will win Digital Goodies or just bragging rights to the win. There is no set rule. Typically we try to unlock more valuable Digital Goodies for the winner but we also try to not repeat the Digital Goodies so that the winner gets a wide range of prizes.</h5>
			
			
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-xs-12 tc_info blog-text">
			<h5>Is this legal?</h5>
			<p><b>Absolutely yes!</b> As per Indian Laws Skill based Games can be played for Game Points by paying Game Points. The predominance of Skill is the most important thing and this is why we have chosen to bring to Indian Gaming Community the most clearly Skill based game format – Quizzing or Trivia.</p>
